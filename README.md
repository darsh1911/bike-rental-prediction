# Bike Rental Prediction
Data Set -
1) ​day.csv

Problem statement -
The objective of this project is to predict daily count for a bike rental company based on the environmental and seasonal settings.

The details of data attributes in the dataset are as follows -
instant: Record index
dteday: Date
season: Season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
yr: Year (0: 2011, 1:2012)
mnth: Month (1 to 12)
hr: Hour (0 to 23)
holiday: weather day is holiday or not (extracted fromHoliday Schedule)
weekday: Day of the week
workingday: If day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
weathersit: (extracted fromFreemeteo)

2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min),
t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in hourly scale)
atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-
t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (only in hourly scale)
hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)
windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)
casual: count of casual users
registered: count of registered users
cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered
